<p>Keeping this here for reference and learning material</p>
<p>Using Mocha to test applications, these files go over some of the basic principles behind Mocha
such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assertion libraries such as Expect</li>
  <li>Testing asynchronous functions</li>
  <li>Testing Express servers</li>
  <li>Testing with Spies and using the Rewire module</li>
  <li>Using the Supertest module combined with Expect</li>
  <li>Using proper organization with describe()</li>
</ul>

<p>note: can run these tests continuously with a custom script 'npm run test-watch'</p>
